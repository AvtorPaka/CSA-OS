Retired Chief Petty Officer David Goggins is well known for his physical
and mental toughness and for his practically inhuman level of determination.
From barely passing his Navy SEAL physical screening test to becoming one of the world’s best ultra-endurance athletes.
And the only person to complete Navy SEAL training Army Ranger School, an Air Force tactical air controller training.
David routinely pushes his body to the limits. In 2005, a chopper carrying eight SEALs and eight Army special operations
aviators were shot down. Many Navy men who David had personally trained with, touched by their loss.
David was determined to find a way to help. Running 135 miles in just under 26 hours, taking first place in the
Infinitus 88 K in only 12 hours, and holding the Guinness World Book World record for over 4000 pull-ups in 24 hours
all to raise awareness and support for severely wounded warriors and their families. Ladies and gentlemen, it brings
a great deal of pleasure to present to you the recipient of the VFW as American as a moored and retired Chief Petty
Officer David Goggins.

David Goggins
First off, I’m very humbled to be up here talking to you all today. For a living, I’m a motivational speaker and I speak to thousands 
of professional athletes from the biggest names to the smallest names. And I saw Doc walk in here with the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
This was the first time in my life I got nervous to speak in front of a crowd. That said, must I respect this man up here. I was reading about this man back in the day. 
So, I’d like to thank the VFW very much for giving me this award. It means more than meeting anything I’ve ever received in my entire life. I’d like to thank my grandfather, 
Sergeant Jack Gardner, who is now deceased. This would be the happiest day of his entire life.

I’d like to thank my mom up here, who would never pick me up… who never pick me up when I fail. 
She taught me how to get up when I was knocked down. I thank my uncle for always being there for me. 
And I thank all you are here who fought in these wars. You have no idea how big of a deal it is to me. 
I was not always this strong guy you see. I went through a lot of hard times in my life to get here today. 
And a story I’ll tell you with real quick. I tried once to get in the Air Force to be Air Force pararescuemen and I quit for fear of the water. 
I was 175 pounds. I left the air force four years later at 300 pounds.
I went from 175 to 300 pounds. There’s a long story in there on how that came to be, but I sat around and read a book on the 
Medal of Honor. In those guys, all I wanted to be was an uncommon man. In my whole life I was not that… much worse than that. 
There were stories about men like you, Doc, who had the courage to jump on grenades and stuff like that. So I came home one day 
from working at a job called Ecolab, where I sprayed for cockroaches, made $1,000 a month, weighing 300 pounds, and I got home 
and watched a show on Discovery Channel of guys carrying boats and logs, Navy SEAL training. And decided to make a change in my life. 
I called the recruiter up and he asked me these questions. You had to meet a certain… like a certain height and weight limit. I was six foot one and 300 pounds. 
He laughed at me. Seven other recruiters laughed at me. One recruiter finally said, “come on in, I’m too busy to talk on the phone.” He didn’t know how much I weighed.
I walked in the recruiter’s office, he looked at me and he said, “you’re fat and you’re black”, got someone to be a Navy SEAL. I didn’t know they’d only been 35 African-American 
Navy SEALs at that time. In over 70 years. He said, I basically had to lose 106 pounds in less than three months because of my age. I was getting too old. I came back three months later, 106 pounds lighter. I… Thank you.
And literally, I spent 18 months going through Buds, which is a six-month program. Went through three whole weeks. That’s where I met Marcus Atwell, Danny Dietz, Michael Murphy, another Medal of Honor winner. 
I went through hell week with all these guys, real heroes. I am not a hero. I served with real heroes. And from there, I went on to raise over $2 million for special operations Warrior Foundation.
But… I’m going to end with this right here, I have the most respect I can possibly muster up for all of you in this room. I know what it takes to be a combat soldier, and I used to look for courage. 
I thought courage was a man who won the Medal of Honor. It is! But courage is a man who’s going to put those boots on every single day of his life to go out there and fight for this country where nobody even knows what the hell they’re doing. 
What the hell they’re at. You do for the man beside you. Thank you.
