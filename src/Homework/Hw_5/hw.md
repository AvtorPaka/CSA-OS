### 0. Program goal

* Develop a program that determines the maximum value of the argument at which the result of the factorial calculation is placed in a 32-bit machine word. 

* Organize the calculation of the factorial as a subroutine with a loop that returns the found argument in register a0. 

* Implement a solution to the previous problem using a recursive subroutine for calculating the maximum value of the argument, in which the result of calculating the factorial is placed in a 32-bit machine word.
