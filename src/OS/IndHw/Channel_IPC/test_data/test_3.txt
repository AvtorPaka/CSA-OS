Serga Pirat
[Lyrics to the song "Hymn"]

[Intro]
Sorry (Oops), I've gone too far
It's so obvious that no one argues
I won't be satisfied with a loser - I'm ready to fight back!
I am number one — an unreal talent
I tore all enemies apart — took away the PTS

[Verse]
I fly into the fray, press Manta
I burn out mana, press the ult
And they tell me, like: "Pirate, you are a talent"
It is not an option to play against you

[Chorus]
It is unlikely that anyone will ever
Some guy will solo the rink like that
I have never seen such a salting anywhere
And, probably, no one will ever see it again
Never, never
It is unlikely that anyone will ever
Some guy will solo the rink like that
I have never seen such a salting anywhere
And, probably, no one will ever see it again
