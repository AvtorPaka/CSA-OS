If that wasn't enough, Goggins has also completed more than 60 ultra-marathons — many of them involving running more than 100 miles — and holds the Guinness world record for pull-ups, having completed 4,030 in 17 hours.
Reading through his impressive resume, you would be correct in imagining him to be in excellent physical shape; at 43 years old, Goggins still regularly competes in ultra-marathons and runs anywhere from 8 to 30 miles every day. 
However, 18 years ago when he showed up at a Navy recruiting station looking to become a Navy SEAL, it was a different story.
Goggins began his military career at age 19 in the Air Force, with aspirations of becoming a pararescuman. The training was difficult, Goggins said, and involved more swimming than he had expected.
“I wasn't real comfortable in the water — I hated it,” said Goggins.
During training, military doctors told Goggins he had sickle cell anemia — a blood disease — and gave him the option to drop out.
“It kind of gave me a way out,” admitted Goggins. “I didn't want to go back in the water, so I pretty much just quit.”
Instead, Goggins became a tactical air controller, serving the rest of his contract with the Air Force in that career field. Still, Goggins said, the reminder of having dropped out of pararescue school depressed him, and he gained more and more weight as he approached his exit from active duty service.
Upon returning to civilian life, Goggins got a job spraying for cockroaches, and gained more weight, coming in at 297 pounds — more than he'd ever weighed in his life.
That's when he saw a documentary that would change his life.
“I saw this show on the Discovery Channel, and it was just guys going through Hell Week. They were freezing, there was a lot of water, and it brought back memories of me going through pararescue training,” said Goggins.
“So at 297 pounds, I decided to try to be a Navy SEAL.”
Already older than a typical Navy SEAL candidate, and far from being within the weight standards to even join the Navy, Goggins began reaching out to recruiters.
“When you tell a recruiter that you're almost 300 pounds and you want to be a SEAL, it doesn't go too well,” he said. “I got hung up on a lot.”
After weeks of determination, he finally found a recruiter who was willing to give him a chance — as long as Goggins could lose enough weight to ship out within three months.
“I had to lose 106 pounds in less than three months — that's really where it became challenging for me,” said Goggins. “I knew that if I stopped training or became stagnant, there were no calories being burned; so I just basically trained all day long.”
